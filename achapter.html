      We started talking daily.<br>
      I still remember calling you “nanny.”<br>
      It came out of nowhere — just a random nickname.<br><br>
      Our talks were cringe <br>
      But it mattered.

      <br>You weren’t getting your favorite college.<br>
      I was feeling lonely.<br>
      so it just happend <br>
      I brought up that candle thing. <br>
